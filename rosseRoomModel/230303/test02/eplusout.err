   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: There are 4 coincident/collinear vertices; These have been deleted unless the deletion would bring the number of surface sides < 3.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each problem surface, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Severe  ** GetSurfaceData: There are 2 degenerate surfaces; Degenerate surfaces are those with number of sides < 3.
   **   ~~~   ** These surfaces should be deleted.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each problem surface, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 2 zones are not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 14 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Severe  ** AirflowNetwork::Solver::get_input: AirflowNetwork:Multizone:Zone = THERMAL ZONE A
   **   ~~~   **  has only one surface defined in AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface
   **   ~~~   **  Each zone should have at least two surfaces defined in AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface

   **   ~~~   **  has only one surface defined in AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface
   **   ~~~   **  Each zone should have at least two surfaces defined in AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface
   **  Fatal  ** AirflowNetwork::Solver::get_input: Errors found getting inputs. Previous error(s) cause program termination.

   ************* Warning:  Node connection errors not checked - most system input has not been read (see previous warning).
   ************* Fatal error -- final processing.  Program exited before simulations began.  See previous error messages.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
