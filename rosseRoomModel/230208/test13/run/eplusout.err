   ** Warning ** CheckEnvironmentSpecifications: SimulationControl specified doing design day simulations, but no design environments specified.
   **   ~~~   ** ...No design environment results produced. For these results, add appropriate SizingPeriod:* objects for your simulation.
   ** Severe  ** Standard Time Meridian and Time Zone differ by more than 2, Difference="16.0"
   **   ~~~   ** Solar Positions will be incorrect
   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS OFF DISCRETE", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS ON CONTINUOUS", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: There are 4 coincident/collinear vertices; These have been deleted unless the deletion would bring the number of surface sides < 3.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each problem surface, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Severe  ** GetSurfaceData: There are 2 degenerate surfaces; Degenerate surfaces are those with number of sides < 3.
   **   ~~~   ** These surfaces should be deleted.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each problem surface, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 2 zones are not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 14 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
